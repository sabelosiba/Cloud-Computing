## Understanding the cloud
### What is the cloud?
- The cloud is a global network of servers around the world acting as one massive hard drive.
- The five characteristics for basic understanding of what cloud computing means:
  1. On demand self-service - Users of cloud services can set up and use services whenever they need them, without having to directly contact the cloud service provider.
  2. Broad network access - Devices like computers and regular server setups can connect to resources stored in the cloud through the network.
  3. Resource pooling - The cloud service provider combines resources for multiple users and adjusts how much each user gets whenever they need it.
  4. Rapid Elasticity - In cloud computing, resources are adjusted based on changes in demand.
  5. Measured service - Cloud service providers keep track of how much resources users use, control it, and charge users accordingly.

### Cloud computing ecosystem
- The ecosystem 3 categories :
  - Consumers of services - everyday end-users that use cloud services in day-to-day business activities. e.g. Microsoft OneDrive, Google Drive and iCloud
  - Provider of services - cloud providers offer a variety of functions ranging from infrastructure services to applications and tools. e.g. Amazon Web System (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and IBM Cloud.
  - Designer of services - companies build applications and tools. e.g. Accenture, Deloitte, IBM and PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC).
 
### Understanding cloud concepts
- *Cloud computing* offers shared resources like applications, storage, and networking over the internet.
- *Standardization* means using consistent methods and interfaces to provide services.
- Cloud services rely on *automation* to carry out tasks based on rules, resource availability, and security needs. This automation is crucial for allowing users to provision services themselves and for efficiently managing resources.
  
## Understanding cloud deployment models
### Cloud components and clients
- In a cloud services setup, there are three main parts:
  - the device you use to access the cloud,
  - the place where the cloud services are stored (data center),
  - and the connection that links them together.

  - Leading cloud service providers like Microsoft and Amazon have extensive networks of data centers worldwide. These centers are built with redundancy to ensure reliable power, internet connectivity, and physical security.
  - Cloud services are used by individuals and businesses across different platforms. They include storage, email, e-commerce, office tools, and development environments. Users can access these services from devices like phones, tablets, computers, IoT devices, and servers, running on operating systems like Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android.

- Cloud infrastructure can be managed in different ways:

  1. Public Cloud: A cloud service provider (CSP) owns and manages the cloud resources, serving multiple external customers who share these resources.
  2. Private Cloud: Services are exclusively provided to a single organization, which owns and manages its own cloud infrastructure.
  3. Hybrid Cloud: This combines elements of both public and private clouds. Organizations can use a mix of their own private cloud resources and public cloud services from CSPs, or even community cloud deployments, which are shared among organizations with common interests or requirements.

- Imagine a company toolbox with many different tools, each being really good for a specific job. A multicloud environment is like that toolbox, but instead of physical tools, it has different cloud services from various companies.
- This way, different teams in the company can pick the best service for their needs, and the company itself has more choices and flexibility.

## Cloud Delivery Models
- Imagine you're renting an apartment (the cloud service). Here's what you get with each option:
  
### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
- You rent the bare space (hardware) and plumbing (networking). You're responsible for everything else, like furniture (operating system), appliances (applications), and decorations (data).
- There are two options:
  - Public IaaS: This is like renting a computer from a company like Amazon or Microsoft. You pay as you go and can easily scale up or down your resources (like renting a computer by the hour and adding more RAM if needed).
  - Private IaaS: This is like having your own internal IT department create a computer system for you to use within your company. You might have more control but less flexibility.

- IaaS examples: AWS EC2, Microsoft Azure, Rackspace, Digital Ocean
- Target audience: IT administrators
- IaaS is a good option for IT professionals who want to build their own custom systems on a rented infrastructure.

### Platform as a Service
- You rent a furnished apartment (pre-configured hardware and software). You can move your furniture in (applications) and decorate (data), but you can't change the layout (operating system).
- PaaS is a good option for developers who want to quickly build and deploy applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.
- PaaS examples: Google App Engine, Heroku, AWS ElasticBeanstalk, Salesforce
- Target audience: Developers, DBAs

### Software as a Service
- With SaaS, you access the software over the internet, like using Gmail or Netflix.
- You don't need to install or maintain the software yourself - the provider takes care of everything.
- You typically pay a monthly or yearly subscription fee per user.
- SaaS applications are great for everyday tasks like email, document editing, or project management.

- SaaS examples: Microsoft Office 365, Google Apps, WebEx, Dropbox, Netflix
- Target audience: End users

Think of it this way:
- IaaS is like renting a computer.
- PaaS is like renting a computer with pre-installed software for development.
- SaaS is like renting software that's ready to use, like renting a car instead of buying and maintaining one yourself.
